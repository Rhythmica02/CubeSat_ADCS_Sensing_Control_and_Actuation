## Introduction

CubeSats, small satellites with standardized dimensions and masses, have revolutionized space exploration with their cost-effectiveness and versatility. This project focuses on the development of an ADCS to ensure CubeSats maintain their desired orientation throughout their mission lifetime.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a comprehensive ADCS for CubeSat applications.
- Implement sensor fusion algorithms, attitude estimation techniques, and control laws.
- Integrate hardware components and conduct simulation and testing.
- Provide a robust ADCS solution to enhance small satellite capabilities and reliability for various space missions.

## System Architecture

The system architecture of the CubeSat's ADCS includes:

- **Attitude Determination System**: Utilizes sensors like magnetometers, sun sensors, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and GPS receivers to estimate the satellite's orientation.
- **Attitude Control System**: Employs actuators like reaction wheels and magnetorquers to generate necessary torques to maintain or adjust the CubeSat's attitude.

## Implementation

The software implementation of the ADCS is written in Python and consists of several modules and classes. The key components include:

- **Sensor Data Handling**: Methods to update sensor data from various sources.
- **Attitude Estimation Algorithms**: Methods for estimating the satellite's attitude using different sensor data.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Techniques to fuse the attitude estimates from multiple sensors.
- **Control Laws and Actuator Command Generation**: Implementation of a PID controller for attitude control.

## Future Work

- Improving the accuracy of attitude estimation algorithms.
- Enhancing the robustness of control laws.
- Integrating additional sensors and actuators for better performance.
- Conducting hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing.
